## Change Notes

### v1.1.0

- Team Editor is functional and complete enough for camp.
- Made engram data spacier in the action log so it's easier to read
- Fixed issue with bot-weight not being handled correction on save
- First-time users now start with a simple, base-bot
- Static content (images, javascript libraries) are all hosted in the media project and served directly from mazemasterjs.com
